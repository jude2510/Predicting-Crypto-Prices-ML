# Cryptocurrency Forecasting and Correlation Analysis

This repository contains two exploratory projects that apply machine learning and statistical analysis techniques to the cryptocurrency market. The first project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict Bitcoin (BTC) prices, while the second project explores the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## ðŸ§  Project 1: Predicting Bitcoin (BTC) Prices with LSTM

### Overview
With Bitcoinâ€™s volatility and growing market influence, accurate price prediction is essential for traders and investors. This project leverages LSTM neural networksâ€”a specialized form of recurrent neural networks (RNNs)â€”to forecast daily Bitcoin closing prices based on historical data.

### Data
- Source: [Kaggle Dataset â€“ Crypto Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/svaningelgem/crypto-currencies-daily-prices)
- Features used: Daily **closing prices** (focus), along with OHLC data

### Preprocessing
- Cleaned missing data
- Applied `MinMaxScaler` to normalize closing prices between 0 and 1
- Used 60-day input sequences to predict the next dayâ€™s closing price

### Model Architecture
- Framework: Keras (TensorFlow backend)
- Two stacked LSTM layers
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- Dense output layer with one neuron

### Results
- Predicted prices closely aligned with actual market prices
- Visualization showed that the LSTM model captured underlying temporal dynamics well

### Future Scope
- Extendable to other cryptocurrencies
- Can incorporate additional financial indicators
- Could benefit from tuning hyperparameters or using transformer models

## ðŸ“Š Project 2: Correlation Analysis Between Bitcoin and Ethereum

### Overview
This analysis investigates the relationship between BTC and ETH price movements using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a dimensionality reduction technique that reveals patterns in multivariate data.

### Data
- Daily closing prices from Ethereumâ€™s launch (August 2015) to present
- Standardized using `StandardScaler` to zero-mean and unit-variance

### Method
- PCA applied to standardized BTC and ETH price series
- Scree plot and biplots used for analysis

### Results
- First principal component explained ~95% of total variance
- Biplot showed BTC and ETH separated by ~45Â°, suggesting **moderate positive correlation**
- Confirmed shared trends but distinct dynamics

### Implications
- Highlights value in diversification between BTC and ETH
- Confirms co-movement patterns while retaining currency-specific drivers
